(b)	the other party is declared or becomes insolvent, has a moratorium declared in respect of any indebtedness, enters into administration, receivership, administrative receivership or liquidation or threatens to do any of these things, takes or suffers any similar action in any jurisdiction or any step is taken (including making of an application, entering into a board resolution or giving of a notice) by it or by any other person in respect of such circumstances; or
(c)	the other party suspends or ceases, or threatens to suspend or cease, carrying on all or a substantial part of its business.
14.2	Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, BundleCorp may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect by giving written notice to the Client if:

(b)	the Client fails to pay any amount due under this Agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than 7 days after being notified in writing to make such payment,
